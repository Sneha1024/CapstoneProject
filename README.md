# Capstone Project-Diagnosis of Acute diseases in smaller towns and villages using AI.

### **AI-Powered Acute Disease Diagnosis for Rural and Small-Town Healthcare**

This project introduces an **AI-driven web-based platform** designed to assist in **early detection and diagnosis of acute diseases** in rural and underserved areas. The user-friendly interface, built with **HTML and CSS**, allows individuals to input symptoms and receive predictive insights on potential health conditions.

### **Core Functionalities**  
ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning Integration:**  
The system leverages **Random Forest Classifier** and **XGBoost**, two robust machine learning algorithms, to analyze patient symptoms and predict possible illnesses.

- **Random Forest:** Uses an ensemble of decision trees to classify patients based on risk factors (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure) and assess their likelihood of developing conditions like **diabetes and heart disease**.  
- **XGBoost:** Processes medical datasets (e.g., Parkinsonâ€™s disease), isolates key predictive features, and enhances diagnostic accuracy through model training and performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced Accessibility:**  
Designed with a simple and intuitive interface, the system ensures that users with limited technical knowledge can navigate and utilize the tool effortlessly.

ðŸ”¹ **Ethical & Bias Considerations:**  
The project emphasizes **fairness and transparency** in AI-driven healthcare. It addresses **bias mitigation** by advocating for **diverse training datasets**, regular model evaluations, and **ethical guidelines** to ensure safe, unbiased, and equitable decision-making.

### **Impact & Future Prospects**  
This initiative aims to **bridge healthcare gaps in remote areas**, enabling **early disease detection, preventive care, and timely intervention**. The system prioritizes **patient safety, data privacy, and transparency**, making AI-powered diagnosis more reliable and accessible for rural communities.
